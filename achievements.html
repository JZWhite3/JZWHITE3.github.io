        <h4>Diversity Club St. Mary's High School</h4>
        <p>Created and managed 1 st Diversity Club at St. Mary’s High School. Through this club I 
            facilitated group discussions on current social injustices and individual viewpoints, 
            this brought students and teachers from different backgrounds together. 
            My vision was to create space and opportunity for students to have conversations and 
            bridge gaps through openness and community building.
