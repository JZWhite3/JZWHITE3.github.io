        <h4>Where do I see myself in the future?</h4>
        <p>As an aspiring information security expert, I have spent the early years of my career 
            collecting experience over a variety of disciplines including system administration, 
            electronic engineering, aviation technology, and IT security. I am interested in process 
            excellence, offensive cyber security, and eventually leading security programs. 
            Currently I am pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology focusing on 
            Cybersecurity at the University of Missouri Columbia, while also pursuing industry 
            certifications like the Comptia Security+ and TCM PNPT.</p>
