            <h3>My Background</h3>
            <p>
                YOUNG. PROFESSIONAL. ENERGETIC. COMPLETELY EXCITED BY TECHNOLOGY. At a young age I was introduced to HTML and CSS through web development, video game development through game salad. Also, I worked with a team in the 
                Cyberpatriot Competition where we worked together to secure a virtual system by managing user capabilities, installing malware and vulnerability assessment software, and managing security settings.
                <br>
                <br>
                During high school I continued to deepen my knowledge of web development and cyber security. 
                I was able to explore aspects of backend development through SQL and PHP. In addition, I was a lead educator at the St. Louis Science Center 
                where I was able to educate the youth from ages four to sixteen on the scientific operation of solar cars. Following graduation from high school, I was hired for an internship with 
                Invention House LLC (Electrical and Electronics Manufacturer) for the position of Senior Lab Technician. Here I had the responsibilities and duties of:
                <br>
                <br>
                Experience with lab equipment including: spectrum analyzers, networking analyzers, oscilloscopes, and multimeters.<br>
                   - Hand Solder Wires, Terminals (through-hole & SMT)<br>
                   - Experience with Mentor Graphics Xpedition PCB Design Software<br>
                   - Test Fixture Development (Wiring Diagram/ Schematic)
                <br>
                <br>
                In addition, to working and going to school I have taken part in the SavvyCoders Web Development Boot Camp where I have learned JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and obtained the Agile Certification. 
                I plan to continue to dive deeper into the topics of web development through completing Harvard's CS50 course 
                where I will get in depth instructions of Github, HTML, CSS, Flask, Django, SQL, API, JavaScript, SPA, and web development security topics. Similarly, for cyber security I will begin studying for the Security+ certification.
